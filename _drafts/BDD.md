# BDD

> Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative approach, made up of three practices: Discovery, Formulation and Automation.



## Living Documentation

"Living documentation" automatically tells us when the system and the documentation are out of sync. This may be for one of several reasons:

- the behaviour specified has not yet been implemented
- the implementation contains a defect
- the documentation is out of date

User stories were created to be "placeholders for a conversation." They allow us to defer detailed analysis until we're confident that the behaviour they describe actually needs to be developed.
