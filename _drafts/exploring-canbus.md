title: Exploring CAN bus
#abbrlink: 46295

This time I want to explore the [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) standard, it defines a protocol that enables micro controllers to communicate with each other without a central host device. This might be interesting in the context of IoT.

Most of the information concerning can be found in specifications and white papers published by Bosch, where CAN bus was developed initially.

# Python implementation

As I am not familiar with the CAN protocol I just googled around and found an implementation that supports it in Python called [python-can](http://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The documentation is good and Python is simple enough to get started with some prototyping.

My first aim is to get some data from a canbus interface and print it via a Python script.
