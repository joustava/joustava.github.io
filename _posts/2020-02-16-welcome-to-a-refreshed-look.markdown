Finally made the time to migrate to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the backbone of my blog. For the theme I opted to use the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. After a few tweaks here and there with the help of the excellent documentation of both projects, this is the result!

How do you like the new look?
