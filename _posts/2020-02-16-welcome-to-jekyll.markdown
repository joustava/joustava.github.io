Finally made the time to migrate to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the backbone of my blog. For the UI I opted to use the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. After a few tweaks here with the help of the excellent ducomentation, this is the result.

How do you like the new look?
