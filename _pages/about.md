This blog is an amalgamation of notes I make while working on spare-time projects.

I've been active in the software industry for over 10 years and build solutions with the help of C, JavaScript, Ruby, Elixir and Docker. Most of these where backend systems and the occasional prototypes build with Vue.js, React or React-Native.

Currently I am involved in building solutions for iOS with Swift.

Part of my spare time is reserved for tinkering with micro-controllers and subjects such as BlueTooth LE and C programming. The rest of my time I like to spend on cycling, woodworking, hiking and reading.
